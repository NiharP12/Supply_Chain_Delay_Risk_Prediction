# Supply_Chain_Delay_Risk_Prediction

# Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to predict whether a shipment will be delayed based on key supply chain parameters. By identifying the risk of delivery delays early, the model helps:

- Reduce supply chain disruptions

- Improve customer satisfaction

- Optimize logistics and planning

- Enable data-driven decision-making in shipment operations

The focus is on building a reliable and interpretable classification model using Decision Tree and Random Over Sampling to handle class imbalance. Key business variables such as shipping time, manufacturing cost, weight, and batch rating are used to train the model for accurate predictions.
